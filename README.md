# 1. Get started

OpenCorr is developed and tested in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (VS, community version) on Windows 10. The codes follow the standard of ISO C++ 14, theoretically it can be compiled on other OS like Linux. Developers working in Linux or Unix may refer to a sample of CMake script (/samples/CMakeLists.txt). To use this library, the users are supposed to have basic knowledge and skill about integrated development environment like VS. The building environment requires three freeware libraries:

- Eigen 3.3.9 ([eigen.tuxfamily.org](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)), used for basic operations of matrix.
- OpenCV 3.4.5 ([opencv.org](http://opencv.org)), used to read images, and in the  modules related with image feature and stereovision.
- FFTW 3.3.9 ([fftw.org](http://fftw.org)), used to calculate cross correlation.

These libraries provide excellent instructions for installation. The main procedure can be summarized as the following steps:

1. Download the source files (e.g. .h or .cpp), static library files (.lib), and dynamic link library files (.dll) from the websites;
2. Place them into proper directories in your computer. For example, I created a solution in VS with name of OpenCorr and a project with same name. The source codes are stored in folder "D:\OpenCorr\OpenCorr\", the files of source codes and static libraries of the three libraries are also placed in folder "D:\OpenCorr\", as shown in Figure 1.1;

   ![image](./img/opencorr_folder_list.png)

   *Figure 1.1. An example of directory structure*

3. Set the paths of source files and static library files in VS, as illustrated in Figure 1.2;
   ![image](./img/vs_path_en.png)
   *Figure 1.2. Illustration of setting paths in Visual Studio 2019*

4. Set the additional dependencies in Project->Properties. Open the Additional Dependencies dialog, as shown in Figure 1.3;
   ![image](./img/vs_lib_en.png)

   *Figure 1.3. Illustration of setting additional dependencies in Visual Studio 2019*

Then add the name list of static library files into the editbox. Beware that the file names end with "d" in Debug mode.

5. Place the dynamic link library files (.dll) into the folder where the executable programs are built (e.g. "D:\OpenCorr\x64\Release\", as shown in Figure 1.1), or the directories listed in system Path;

6. Set OpenMP support to enable the acceleration on multi-core CPU, as shown in Figure 1.4.
   ![image](./img/vs_openmp_en.png)
   *Figure 1.4. Illustration of setting OpenMP support in Visual Studio 2019*

To facilitate the configuration for beginners, we made a zip package of the three libraries and share it on [pan.baidu.com](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17qdAhXJZPLWydYiowwEzig) (code: vyfy). Users may download and unzip it, then set the paths according to the instructions provided above.

There are a few examples in the folder "samples" along with images, which demonstrate how to make a DIC program using the modules in OpenCorr. Before building the executables, make sure that the file paths in the codes are correctly set. 

# 2. Framework

OpenCorr consists of four parts: (1) basic data objects; (2) DIC data objects; (3) basic processing methods; (4) DIC processing methods. Figure 2.1 shows the framework of OpenCorr, which gives a guide to understand the structure of this library.
![image](./img/framework_en.png)
*Figure 2.1. Framework of OpenCorr*

### 2.1. Basic data objects:

(1) Point (oc_point.h and oc_point.cpp). Figure 2.1.1 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. The main parameter of point is its coordinate. It can also be regarded as a vector, indicating the offset from one point to another. Thus, a function (i.e. vectorNorm()) is provided to calculate the magnitude of the vector.  Moreover, operator "+" and "-" are overloaded to perform the superimposition of an offset on the coordinate of a point. Operator "*" and "/" for the coordinate of a point multiplied or divided by a scalar. Operator "<<" is also overloaded to output the coordinate of a point, in the form of  "x, y" (Point2D) or "x, y, z" (Point3D).

![image](./img/oc_point_en.png)
*Figure 2.1.1. Parameters and methods included in Point object*

(2) Array/matrix (oc_array.h and oc_array.cpp). Figure 2.1.2 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. The object is simple, as the operations of matrix in this library call the functions of Eigen. It contains the functions of create and delete two dimensional, three dimensional and four dimensional arrays, as well as the specifical definition of Eigen matrices.

![image](./img/oc_array_en.png)
*Figure 2.1.2. Parameters and methods included in Array object*

(3) Image (oc_image.h and oc_image.cpp). Figure 2.1.3 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. OpenCV functions is called to read image file and get its dimension, as well as store the data into the Eigen matrices with same size. Caution: Users working with OpenCV 4 may need to modify the codes of this object, as some basic functions in OpenCV 4 are different from the ones in OpenCV 3.

![image](./img/oc_image_en.png)
*Figure 2.1.3. Parameters and methods included in Image object*

### 2.2. DIC data objects:

(1) Subset (oc_subset.h and oc_subset.cpp). Figure 2.2.1 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. Subset can be regarded as a special matrix with its center located at a specific point. Its height and width equal to two times of corresponding radius plus one. The constructor of this object sets the parameters mentioned above and initialize the Eigen matrix. Its menber function fill(Image2D* image) is used to read grayscale data in a specific region from an Image object and store the data into its Eigen matrix. Function zeroMeanNorm() performs the zero mean normalization of grayscale value at every point in the subset and return the normalization factor.

![image](./img/oc_subset_en.png)
*Figure 2.2.1. Parameters and methods included in Subset object*

(2) Deformation (oc_deformation.h and oc_deformation.cpp). Figure 2.2.2 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. Deformation includes two dimensional one and three dimensional one, which can be described using the first order shape function and the second shape function. In 2D case, the 1st order shape function contains 6 elements (displacement u and v, as well as their gradients along x- and y-axis), its warp_matrix is a 3x3 matrix. The 2nd order shape function contains 12 elements (displacement u and v, as well as their first and second order gradients along x- and y-axis), its warp_matrix is a 6x6 matrix.

Member functions include:

- setDeformation() without input, set the deformation elements according current warp_matrix;
- setDeformation() with input, set the deformation elements and update warp_matrix, according the input;
- setDeformation() with another Deformation instance as input, set the deformation elements and update warp_matrix, according the given instance;
- setWarp(), update warp_matrix according to current deformation elements;
- Point2D warp(Point2D& point), calculate the coordinates of a point after experiencing the deformation.

![image](./img/oc_deformation_en.png)
*Figure 2.2.2. Parameters and methods included in Deformation object*

(3) POI (Point of interest, oc_poi.h and oc_poi.cpp). Figure 2.2.3 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. POI inherits the properties and methods from Point object. In addition, it contains a deformation vector and a result vector. The former is used in DIC processsing, and the latter for output results. Especially, POI2DS is an object designed for stereo DIC, which inherits the properties from Point2D, but contains a three dimensional deformation vector of 0th order. The constructor of POI sets the coordinate, and clear the deformation vector and result vector meanwhile.

Member functions include:

- clean(), set all the elements in deformation vector and result vector as zero;
- setIterationCriteria(float conv_criterion, float stop_condition, float neighbor_essential), set the convergence criterion and stop condition of iterative DIC methods, as well as the minimum number required in the neighbor keypoints search when processing the POI.

![image](./img/oc_poi_en.png)
*Figure 2.2.3. Parameters and methods included in POI object*

### 2.3. Basic processing methods:

(1) Gradient (oc_gradient.h and oc_gradient.cpp). Figure 2.3.1 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. OpenCorr currently provides only one gradient calculation method, i.e. 4th-order central difference, which may be the most popular one. grad_img, points to the Image2D object to process, is initialized in constructor. Member functions getGradientX() and getGradientY() are made to calculate the 1st-order gradient map along x and y direction, respectively. getGradientXY() calculates the mixed 2nd-order gradient map. The gradient maps are stored in Eigen matrices gradient_x, gradient_y, and gradient_xy, respectively.

![image](./img/oc_gradient_en.png)
*Figure 2.3.1. Parameters and methods included in Gradient object*

(2) Interpolation (oc_interpolation.h and oc_interpolation.cpp). Figure 2.3.2 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. Interpolation is a base class which contains essential parameter, i.e. interp_img pointing to the Image2D object to process. The derived class BicubicBspline (oc_bicubic_bspline.h and oc_bicubic_bspline.cpp) implemented the popular bicubic B-spline interpolation method. Our study indicates that the bicubic B-spline interpolation shows significaninterpolationtly improved accuracy and precision compared with the bicubic method, at a trial computational cost (Pan et al. Theo Appl Mech Lett, 2016, 6(3):126-130). Member function prepare() calculates the global lookup-table of interpolation coefficients of interp_image, while compute(Point2D& location) estimates the grayscale value at the input location according to the lookup-table.

![image](./img/oc_interpolation_en.png)
*Figure 2.3.2. Parameters and methods included in Interpolation object*

(3) Feature (oc_feature.h and oc_feature.cpp). Figure 2.3.3 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. Feature is a base class which contains essential parameters, i.e. ref_img and tar_img pointing to the Image2D objects (reference image and target image). Member function setImages(Image2D& ref_img, Image2D& tar_img) is used to update ref_img and tar_img. The derived class SIFT2D (oc_sift.h and oc_sift.cpp) provides the method to extract and match the SIFT features in the two images. Structure sift_config contains the main paramters in feature extraction. Users may refer to the relevant documents of OpenCV for their meanings. Parameter match_ratio is the threshold of ratio of the shortest distance betweeen the descriptors of reference feature and target feature to the second shortest distance. The details of this parameter can be found in Lowe's famous paper (Lowe, Int J Comput Vis, 2004, 60(2):91-110). The extracted keypoints, after matching, are stored in vectors ref_matched_kp and tar_matched_kp.

Member functions include:

- prepare(), assign the address of matrices in ref_img and tar_img to OpenCV matrices ref_mat and tar_mat;
- compute(), extract the features in reference image and target image, and then match them;

*Figure 2.3.4. Parameters and methods included in Calibration object*

(5) Stereovision (oc_stereovision.h and oc_stereovision.cpp). Figure 2.3.5 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. It is used to reconstruct the 3D coordinate of a point in space based on the two matched 2D points in left view and right view.

![image](./img/oc_stereovision_en.png)
*Figure 2.3.5. Parameters and methods included in Stereovision object*

*Figure 2.3.5. Parameters and methods included in IO object*

### 2.4. DIC processing methods:

The base class DIC (oc_dic.h and oc_dic.cpp) contains a few essential parameters:

- Pointer of reference image and target image, ref_img å’Œ tar_img;
- Subset radii (in x and y direction), subset_radius_x, subset_radius_y;
- Number of CPU threads in parallel processing, thread_number.

Member function setImages(Image2D& ref_img, Image2D& tar_img) is used to set the pointers of ref_img and tar_img, and setSubsetRadii(int subset_radius_x, int subset_radius_y) for setting subset radii. Three virtual member functions indicate the forms of main functions in this class: prepare() for preparation; compute(POI2D* POI) to process single POI, and compute(std::vector& POI_queue) to process a batch of POIs.

It is noteworthy that the methods in derive classes are designed for path-independent DIC, but they can also be employed to realize the DIC methods with initial guess transfer mechanisms. For example, the popular reliability-guided DIC can be readily implemented by combining C++ vector and its sort functions with the DIC methods listed below.

(1) FFTCC2D (oc_fftcc.h and oc_fftcc.cpp), fast Fourier transform aided cross correlation. Figure 2.4.1 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. The method calls FFTW library to perform FFT and inverse FFT calculation. Its principle can be found in our paper (Jiang et al. Opt Laser Eng, 2015, 65:93-102). An auxiliary class FFTW is made to facilitate parallel processing, as the procedure need allocate quite a lot of memory blocks dynamically. During the initialization of FFTCC2D, a few FFTW instances are created according to the input thread_number. Afterwards, they are called in compute(POI2D* POI) through getInstance(int tid). The POIs stored in container vector can be processed by compute(std::vector& POI_queue).

![image](./img/oc_fftcc_en.png)
*Figure 2.4.1. Parameters and methods included in FFTCC2D object*

(2) FeatureAffine2D (oc_feature_affine.h and oc_feature_affine.cpp), image feature aided affine estimation. Figure 2.4.2 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. The method estimates the affine matrix according to the keypoints around a POI in order to get the deformation at the POI. Users may refer to our paper (Yang et al. Opt Laser Eng, 2020, 127:105964) for details of principle and implementation. It is noteworthy at those POIs with few keypoints nearby, compute(POI2D* POI) corrects the nearest kepoints out of searching region until the number reaches the set minimun value.

![image](./img/oc_feature_affine_en.png)
*Figure 2.4.2. Parameters and methods included in FeatureAffine2D object*

(3) ICGN2D1 (ICGN algorithm with 1st-order shape function) and ICGN2D2 (ICGN algorithm with 2nd-order shape function), codes are stored in oc_icgn.h and oc_icgn.cpp. Figure 2.4.3 and Figure 2.4.4 show the parameters and methods included in the two objects. The principle and implementation of ICGN2D1 can be found in our paper (Jiang et al. Opt Laser Eng, 2015, 65:93-102). Users may refer to the paper by Professor ZHANG Qingchuan's group (Gao et al. Opt Laser Eng, 2015, 65:73-80) for detailed information of ICGN2D2. Auxiliary classes ICGN2D1_ and ICGN2D2_ are made for parallel processing because the procedures also require a lot of dynamically allocated memory blocks. The implementation and usage are similar to the one in FFTCC2D.

![image](./img/oc_icgn1_en.png)
*Figure 2.4.3. Parameters and methods included in ICGN2D1 object*

![image](./img/oc_icgn2_en.png)
*Figure 2.4.4. Parameters and methods included in ICGN2D2 object*

(4) EpipolarSearch (oc_epipolar_search.h and oc_epipolar_search.cpp), Epipolar constraint aided search for stereo matching. Figure 2.4.5 shows the parameters and methods included in this object. The method uses the epipolar constraint between the two views, search the counterpart (in view2) of a point (in view1), narrowing the searching range in part of epipolar line. The searching range centered at intersection epipolar line and its normal line crossing a point estimated according to an initial displacement and  a guess of parallax. And the searching step is limited to a couple pixels (less than convergence radius). Users may refer to our paper (Lin et al. Opt Laser Eng, 2022, 149:106812) for details of principle and implementation. This method calls ICGN2D1 method with lenient convergence criterion and less iteration to guarantee roughly accurate matching in trials, and reserve the result with highest ZNCC value, which can be fed into ICGN2D2 method for high accuracy matching. Caution: Multi-thread processing is NOT suggested in compute(std::vector<POI2D>& poi_queue), which may mess the processing around with the ICGN2D1 instance running in multi-thread mode. test_3d_reconstruction_epipolar.cpp in folder /samples gives a simple example, which demonstrates the reconstruction of a 3D point cloud using this module.

Parameters include:

- Objects of two cameras: view1_cam (principal) and view2_cam (secondary);
- Fundamental matrix to locate epipolar line, fundamental_matrixï¼›
- Parameters in stepped searching, search_radius, search_step, parallax;
- Parameters in ICGN2D1: icgn_sr_x, icgn_sr_y, icgn_conv, icgn_stop;

![image](./img/oc_epipolar_search_en.png)

*Figure 2.4.5. Parameters and methods included in EpipolarSearch object*

(5) Strain2D (oc_strain.h and oc_strain.cpp), calculation of strains based on the DIC results. Figure 2.4.6 shows the parameters and methods included in this objects. The method first creates local profiles of displacement components in POI-centered subregion through polynomial fitting, and then calculates the strains according to the first order derivatives of the profile. Users may refer to the paper by Professor PAN Bing (Pan et al. Opt Eng, 2007, 46:033601) for the details of the principle.

Parameters include:

- Topleft corner of ROI: topleft_point;
- Radius of subregion: subregion_radius;
- Space between adjacent POIs: grid_space;
- 2D matrices of displacement components: u_map, v_map.

Member functions include:

- setSubregionRadius(int subregion_radius), set the radius of the POI-centerd subregion for fitting of local displacement profiles;
- setGridSpace(int grid_space), set space between the adjacent POIs, which should be identical to the value set in DIC computation;
- setDisplacement(std::vector& POI_queue), create u_map and v_map according to the results of DIC;
- compute(POI2D* POI), calculate the strains at the POI.

# 3. GPU accelerated modules

GPU accelerated modules currently include a module of ICGN algorithm with shape functions of the 1st and the 2nd order. Developers can use them through calling dynamic link libraries.
Requirements:

- Hardware: NVIDIA graphics card with memory greater than 2GB
- Software: Windows OS, CUDA ToolKit 11.4

GPU accelerated ICGN module consists of three files: head (opencorr_gpu.h), static library (OpenCorrGPULib.lib), and dynamic link library (OpenCorrGPULib.dll). The configuration of IDE is similar to the one of FFTW, which can be summarized as four steps:

1. Put opencorr_gpu.h into the folder where opencorr.h is, as shown in Figure 3.1;
   
   ![image](./img/gpu_head_en.png)
   
   *Figure 3.1. Placing opencorr_gpu.h in the same folder of opencorr.h*

2. Set the path of static library file in VS (for example, OpenCorrGPULib.lib is in folder opencorrGPU\lib in Figure 1.1), as illustrated in Figure 3.2;
   
   ![image](./img/vs_gpu_path_en.png)
   
   *Figure 3.2. Setting path of library in Visual Studio 2019*

3. Add OpenCorrGPULib.lib as the additional dependencies, as illustrated in Figure 3.3;
   
   ![image](./img/vs_gpu_lib_en.png)
   
   *Figure 3.3. Setting additional dependencies of library in Visual Studio 2019*

4. Let OpenCorrGPULib.dll be in the same folder of the built executable program (.exe).

test_2d_dic_gpu_icgn2.cpp in folder /samples demonstrates how to use the module. The data structures in this module are a little different from those in OpenCorr (CPU version) to achieve high computation efficiency. Thus, the reference image and the target image need to be converted to 1D arrays. An additional POI queue is generated and assigned with the location and initial guess for each POI. After the processing, the obtained results need to be transferred back to the original POI queue for the convenience of output by calling the OpenCorr functions.
